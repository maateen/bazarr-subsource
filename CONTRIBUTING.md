```

## Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

This project follows PEP 8 with some modifications:

- **Line length**: Maximum 88 characters (Black's default)
- **String quotes**: Use double quotes for strings
- **Import organization**: Use isort for import sorting
- **Code formatting**: Use Black for code formatting
- **Linting**: Use flake8 for code quality checks

### Pre-commit Hooks

The project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting
- **Basic hooks**: Trailing whitespace, end of file, etc.

Run pre-commit manually:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Documentation

- **Docstrings**: Use Google-style docstrings for all functions and classes
- **Comments**: Write clear, concise comments for complex logic
- **README**: Update README.md if you add new features
- **Type hints**: Use type hints where appropriate

### Testing

While this project doesn't have a full test suite yet, please:

- **Test your changes** manually with different configurations
- **Verify imports** work correctly
- **Check error handling** with invalid inputs
- **Test with different Python versions** if possible
